    - Add Scraping of JOC.com website --> Currently not included
    - Add modularity in backend for scraping, can have one function which is called depending on each website
    - Error handling has not been implemented in case of bad response from backend; Hence this will be a major improvement
    - Database for storing the headlines
    - Frontend can be improved in styling
    - Unit testing of scraping function can be conducted prior to pulling data from backend
